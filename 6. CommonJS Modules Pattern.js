//======================================================
//================ CommonJS Module Pattern ======================
//======================================================
//this is very importent  because they have been used in NodJs for almost all of its existing

//===== why CommonJs Moduel  .. what about ES6 ======
//ES6 Module are recently technolgy so they are not much implemented in Nodejs
//In NPM library  so many  libaraies and Commponent are Writen in  commonJs Module.
//so its very importent to understand the syntax of CommonJs module


//---- Just Like  ES6 Module ----
//CommonJs also has      1 Module contian 1 file
//CommonJs also has      Import   _  Export  butt differnt syntax

//--- Syntax ---- this wil give error on local js. because its used in  NodeJs

// //--- Import ----
// export.function(product,quantity) {
//     cart.push({product,quantity});
//     console.log(`
//         ${quantity} ${product} added to cart (shipping cost is ${shippingCost})
//     `);
// }
// //--- Export ----
// const {addToCart} = require('./shoppingCart.js')


//======== In Feauture Hoppfully these commonJs will be replace with ES6 module ========
